This isn't some brilliant design for a web site. Actually, this is quite possibly my first legitimate attempt at designing something. It's not really something for winning the Pulitzer of aesthetic usability. 

## Structure

The reason I'm writing this readme, is because there's a good chance that someone is going to be stuck maintaining this website at some point (i.e. the imminent future circa two weeks from now). I might as well try explaining how this website is built (in spite of the fact that it very much isn't).

## Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

I think I might as well put literary references here so I can feign cultural sophistication. But on a more serious and technical note (muah ha ha, I'm still a prosaic ignoramus), this website uses Jekyll to generate the underlying static site. 

The reason is fairly straightforward.
