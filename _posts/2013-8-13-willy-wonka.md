So I don't have time to write it up, because honestly I haven't figured out a good way to write it, but here's the basic story outlined in a few bullets

* Willy Wonka creates a birthday party continuation of the golden ticket thing, if you get a golden ticket you can come and have a birthday party at the factory
* The chocolate factory is only capable of a single birthday party a day, otherwise the oompa loompas will complain about being overworked and unionize and strike and sabotage machinery
* A chocolate competitor copies Wonka and sends more tickets to entice little kids, forcing wonka to send more tickets
* Little does he know that once he sends out the 23rd ticket, there is a 50% chance that he has doomed his factory
