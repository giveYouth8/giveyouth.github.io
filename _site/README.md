# GIVE

This isn't some brilliant design for a web site. Actually, this is quite possibly my first legitimate attempt at designing something. It's not really something for winning the Pulitzer of aesthetic usability. 

## Structure

The reason I'm writing this readme, is because there's a good chance that someone is going to be stuck maintaining this website at some point (i.e. the imminent future circa two weeks from now). I might as well try explaining how this website is built (in spite of the fact that it very much isn't).
