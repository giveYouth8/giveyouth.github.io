The purpose of the GIVE Core Team is to serve as a governing body for the organization. It is divided into two committees: the Administrative Committee and the Tutoring Committee. Each committee has its own objectives (refer below). Organizational decisions are made and initiatives are carried out in the Core Team. In the fall, GIVE Center Directors and Center Managers will be selected from the Core Team, and the following year, new Directors will be selected among the returning Core Team members.
