<p>
Thank you for your willingness to donate!
</p>
<p>
Since GIVE is a community non-profit organization, we can only continue our programs if we have enough donors!
</p>
<p>
GIVE is committed to ensuring most donations are directly offered to sudents, so all legal and financial work is done by its directors or generous volunteers.
