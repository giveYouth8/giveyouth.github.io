Donate

Thank you for your willingness to donate!

Since GIVE is a community non-profit organization, we can only continue our programs if we have enough donors!

GIVE is committed to ensuring most donations are directly offered to sudents, so all legal and financial work is done by its directors or generous volunteers.

Credit Card/Online: You can now use our new widget to donate online with your credit card! https://www.airbanking.com/tools/payments/donate?init=Y&charity_code=vEqa1YRNC1s

Cash: Please give cash donations to a GIVE Center Manager at any of our eleven locations!

Check: Checks are to be written to "GIVE" and may be processed online at 
https://www.airbanking.com/tools/payments/donate?init=Y&charity_code=vEqa1YRNC1s
or mailed to 3133 Barkley Drive Fairfax, VA 22031.

In addition to financial contributions, GIVE also takes:

--Any volunteer time offered to help GIVE gain recognition (mainly by media) or raise funds

--Gently used/new student workbooks and/or textbooks for all grade levels and abilities

--Gently used/new test preparation books (can be for any standardized test and not just the SAT or ACT)

--Any type of school supplies/office materials (for students in the tutoring program)

--Help with skills/suggestions for improvement. For example, Main Street Bank has generously offered free banking and financial consulting



What are Donations Used for?

--Workbooks for all grade levels (usually K-6) that are used by all tutors in each of the centers. These are renewed each year and are expensive!

--Funding the GIVE book project so that more can be printed and distributed to schools and libraries at no cost

--Supplies such as notebooks, paper, and pencils for students to use at the tutoring centers

--Snack for all students at each of the eleven centers each week

--Occasional events such as the end of the year celebration for GIVE students

--Maintenance of the GIVE website

--Legal transactions such as state and federal government recognition/membership fees on non-profit organizations
