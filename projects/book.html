GIVE is currently in the process of publishing a children's book, titled "Being Different is what Makes Us Special!", which promotes cultural/religious tolerance and awareness of bullying. These books are to be distributed to elementary schools across the county to spread awareness for this issue, especially in relation to the prevalence of recent bullying incidents.
