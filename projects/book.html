In May 2011, GIVE published a book titled “Being Different is what Makes Us Special!” This book was published bearing in mind of the main goals of GIVE: education, as well as cultural/religious tolerance and awareness of bullying. These books are being distributed to elementary schools across the county to spread awareness for this issue, especially in relation to the prevalence of recent bullying incidents.
