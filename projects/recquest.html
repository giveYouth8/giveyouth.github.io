<h2>RecQuest Program Summer 2012</h2>
We need volunteer leaders for the RecQuest STEM program that Kartik Gupta, the COO and co-founder of GIVE, is running over the summer in conjunction with the Fairfax County Department of Community and Recreation Services. The goal of this project is to increase and foster STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) interest in elementary school students. Leaders will be working with elementary school students and will conduct science demonstrations one to two days a week for two-hour periods. 


<h2>Potential Activities </h2>
<ul>
<li>Penny Cleaning: demonstrate and explain how a mixture of vinegar and table salt can be used to clean the grime off of dirty pennies.</li>
<li>Persistence of vision: explain how physics and your brain work together to form optical illusions using a hands-on demonstration.</li>
<li>Oobleck: Teach a lesson about the states of matter along with an experiment on oobleck, a mixture of corn starch and water.</li>
<li>Voltaic cell: Explain how electricity and circuits work by creating a home-made battery using simple household products.</li>
</ul>
