With the end of AP exams and SATs, many students throw away their used prep books. In response to this, GIVE is hosting a book drive in high schools to collect these unwanted study aid guides and distribute them to high school students across the DC Metropolitan Area who plan to take these courses next year, but may not have the means to afford the materials.
