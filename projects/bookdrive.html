With the end of AP exams and SAT's, many students throw away their used prep books. In response to this, GIVE hosted a book drive in local FCPS high schools to collect these unwanted study aid guides and distribute them to high school students across the DC Metropolitan Area who plan to take these courses next year, but may not have the means to afford the materials. In June 2012, estimated retail value totalled $4000 dollars. GIVE received books from students across the county at our drop off locations. The collections books total an estimated retail value of 4000. This year we hope to expand the book drive to schools around the county so that we can collect hunderes of books and build partnersips with both our donor and recipient schools.
